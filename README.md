# libdwata
graph + ai in your products; reduce costs and get correct answers from your data

## What is libdwata?
Create a knowledge graph from your data and use large language models to extract entities and relationships.
The extracted entities and relationships are then inserted into the graph, enriching the data already in there.
This allows for a very well connected view of your data, which dramatically improves the correctness of answers.

libdwata takes care of:
- Data storage with RocksDB at your given storage path
- Data ingestion from your API, files, databases, etc.
- Graph creation and manipulation
- Integration with Large Language Models (your API keys)
