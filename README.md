# Pixlie AI
graph + ai in your products; reduce costs and get correct answers from your data

## What is Pixlie AI?
Pixlie AI is a framework to create applications that use a graph + LLM approach to semantic search, knowledge base,
question/answering, and more. Pixlie AI is batteries included and ready to use out of the box.

Create a knowledge graph from your data and use large language models to extract entities and relationships.
The extracted entities and relationships are then inserted into the graph, enriching the data already in there.
This allows for a very well connected view of your data, which dramatically improves the correctness of answers.

## How does it work?
Pixlie AI is a framework that you can use in your products, share data to it and tweak the graph using the API.
Pixlie AI takes care of:
- Data storage with RocksDB
- APIs to send your data to it (similar to search engines)
- Graph creation and management
- Integration with Large Language Models (your API keys)
- Entity and relationship extraction from your data
- Enrich the graph with extracted entities and relationships
- Query the graph using an API or natural language
- API to browse the graph and all related data

## What does this solve?
Have you every had a conversation with an LLM and saw that the answers are not always correct?
This is exactly what we want to solve. The graph is a rich set of connections between your data and all the
real world attributes they have. LLMs are great at finding details in data but are not so good at keeping
track of everything. The graph stores and retrieves all the data and metadata (from LLMs) deterministically.

This is an alternative to using vectors databases for Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) and other similar
techniques.
